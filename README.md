<H1>UCF Data Vizualization - Project 1</H1>

<H2>Project Title:</H2>
<p>Quality of Public Schools versus Single Family Housing Prices in <b>Florida</b>.</p>
<p>Null hypothesis - to reject that quality public schools has no correlation with single family house prices.</p>

<br>
<H2>Project Description/Outline:</H2>
	<p>Using the skills and tools learnt in our Data Analytics course work such as Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, various frameworks and libraries we will explore ways to collect data. We will use data readily available on <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/">Zillow</a> and <a href="http://www.fldoe.org/accountability/accountability-reporting/school-grades/">Florida Department of Education</a> to merge data sets.</p>
    <p>Using the datasets we will compute the information based off of zip codes and grade results in math, science, english and social studies to provide data vizualization in order to answer the main two questions:</p>

<br>    
<H2>Scope of Research:</H2>
	<p>An analysis of the relationship of single family housing prices to the quality of public schools offered in Florida.<br><br>
	Assumptions:<br>
      	<ul>
          	<li>Quality is defined as school grades in math, science, english and social studies.<br>&nbsp;</br></li>
          	<li>Zip code of a home is directly related to the zip code of a school or a one-to-one relationship without regards to school zoning.</li>
		</ul>
</p>

<br>
<H2>Research questions to answer:</H2>
	<ul>
        <li>If a public school performs in math, science, english and social studies then is there higher single family housing prices?<br>&nbsp;</br>
        </li>
        <li>Does lower single family housing price drive down the public school quality. Quality is measured in grades in maths, science, english and social studies?</li>
      </ul>
